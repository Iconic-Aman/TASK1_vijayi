# 🛠️ Ticket Classification & Urgency Detection System

This project is designed to automatically classify customer support tickets by **issue type** and **urgency level** using machine learning techniques. It uses a combination of **TF-IDF-based feature extraction**, **pre-trained models**, and optionally **NLP summarization with BART** to understand real-world customer feedback.
